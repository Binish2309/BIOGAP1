src/ingestion/osm_context.py

Real ingestion connector for OpenStreetMap road/path network data via the
public Overpass API -- the CONTEXTUAL layer needed to distinguish a
genuine biodiversity gap from a recording gap.

WHY THIS EXISTS
----------------
The bias literature reviewed in this project's Stage 1 report is
consistent: accessibility (road/path density, proximity to trails) is the
single strongest predictor of WHERE citizen-science observation effort
concentrates -- stronger than population density in several studies (Tiago
et al. 2017, Scientific Reports, found path/trail density the strongest
predictor in 7 of 8 taxonomic groups studied). This module fetches real
road/path geometry for the study area so BIOGAP can test that relationship
directly: a grid cell with HIGH accessibility but LOW observation density
is much stronger evidence of a recording gap than a cell that is simply
remote and hard to reach.

WHAT THIS MODULE DOES NOT DO
------------------------------
- It does not compute true road LENGTH per grid cell (that requires
  line-in-polygon geometric intersection, out of scope for now). Instead
  it counts OSM way VERTICES (the coordinate points that make up each
  road/path's geometry) falling in each cell, as a documented, honest
  density PROXY -- denser digitised road geometry in a cell produces more
  vertex hits. This is stated explicitly wherever the resulting numbers
  are shown, not silently presented as a precise length measurement.
- It does not fetch population data (e.g. WorldPop). That requires raster
  processing (rasterio) and multi-hundred-MB downloads that would
  reintroduce exactly the memory/timeout problems the staged biodiversity
  ingestion redesign just fixed. It remains a documented, NOT_IMPLEMENTED
  future enhancement -- see RESEARCH_METHOD.md.

REAL, PUBLIC, KEY-FREE API
----------------------------
POST https://overpass-api.de/api/interpreter, body: an Overpass QL query
string. No API key, but please be a good citizen of a free public service:
this connector queries a REDUCED set of highway tags (the ones with
documented relevance to recording accessibility -- primary/secondary/
tertiary/residential roads plus paths/footways/tracks), not everything
OSM has, and is meant to be run ONCE per study area, not repeatedly -- the
result is cached to data/raw/osm_roads_raw.csv and reused.
