src/analysis/taxonomic.py

Taxonomic representation analysis. Reports what SHARE of recorded
observations/species belong to each major group -- explicitly a measure of
RECORDING representation, not of true relative abundance or richness. No
"expected" baseline (e.g. a regional species checklist) is assumed unless
one is explicitly supplied, because we do not have a verified one for MMR
yet (see BIOGAP Stage 1 report, Section 5 on research gaps).
