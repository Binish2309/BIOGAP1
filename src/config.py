src/config.py

Central, configurable settings for BIOGAP. Nothing else in the codebase
should hard-code the study-area geometry, file paths, or API endpoints --
they should all be read from here (or from environment variables /
config.json, which override the defaults below).

RESEARCH INTEGRITY NOTE:
The DEFAULT_BBOX below is a hand-built rectangular APPROXIMATION of the
Mumbai Metropolitan Region, not an official MMRDA administrative polygon.
It is a placeholder for feasibility testing. See DATA_PROVENANCE.md and
RESEARCH_METHOD.md for the full discussion. The geometry is intentionally
configurable (via config.json or environment variables) so it can be
replaced with an authoritative polygon later without touching any other
module.
